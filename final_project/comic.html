            <p> Death can be perceived in many ways by those who see her. Some welcome her as a new beginning, while other fear and despise her.
            </p>
            <p>They blame her for taking away the lives of the ones they loved or their own. But alas, how can you blame? </p>
            <p> For in the end, she is only a Guide in the greater scheme of things. She will greet all with a warm and gentle smile that contradicts the blackrobe she hides behind.</p>
