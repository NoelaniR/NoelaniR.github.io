    <h3> Opening your eyes, you look around. A long hallway to your right and left, stretching for as 
        far as the eye can see. In front of you you is a faded wooden door, the door repeated down both 
        ends but this door in particular catches your attention. </h3>
    <h3>Tape to it is a small single piece of paper that looked like it was ripped 
        out of an old book. On it is  a drawing of a poppy and some text underneath 
    </h3>  
    <h3>[Papaver rhoeas]
        "In the language of flowers, a poppy means-"</h3>
    <h3> The last word is too smudged to make out.
        Turning the page around, there's more text.
    </h3>
    <h3>"Now that you know, isn't it like an exit?"</h3>
    <h3> Know what? you scoff.
        You know in the back of your mind something isn't right but what if it's a way out? You MUST choose.
